THE PORTUGAL OF SALAZAR 
Of the economic Liberalism which prevailed 
in the nineteenth century; and with our genera- 
tion and the next lies the task of reconstructing 
Europe. Internationally, the period of unrestricted 
private enterprise and competition has ended In 
deadlock and confusion. And in all countries 
capitalism has left as its legacy a class of property- 
less and irresponsible workers, destined, despite 
an overproduction resulting from unique techni- 
cal achievement, to lead sub-human existences in 
conditions of poverty and squalor. 

The age of laissez-faire, laissez-passer> has of 
necessity given place to an age of planned econ- 
omy; and parallel to the collapse of economic 
Liberalism has been the failure of political Lib- 
eralism. In their place the new totalitarian 
ideologies are emerging. There is the Marxist 
totalitarianism, which would eliminate from so- 
ciety all classes save the workers and from life all 
spiritual values, and would Itself provide the be-all

and the end-all of human existence; and there is 
the totalitarianism of the new nationalisms, which 
would discipline the individual to an almost mys- 
tical conception of the State. 

The conflict of ideologies to-day presents the 
gravest threat to the peace of the world; but there 
is one man in Europe who, more than any other, 
has shown that totalitarianism is not the only 
alternative to undisciplined individualism, class 
exploitation, and the rule of plutocracy, and that 
there is a possible form of social and economic 
Order that is not the impersonal order of the new 
ideologies. Oliveira Salazar has, during the past 
ten years, brought into being in Portugal a Chris- 
tian and Corporate State which provides justice 
for the long-exploited working classes without 
preaching the appalling doctrine of the class war, 
which provides order in the nation without arro- 
gating to the State functions which do not prop- 
erly belong to it, and which appeals to Nationalism 
with due regard for the responsibilities of the Na- 
tion as a component part of a common European 
whole.
